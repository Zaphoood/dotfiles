# Dotfiles
I got the idea for managing my dotfiles this way from [this blogpost](https://www.ackama.com/what-we-think/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained/).

## Installing
Clone the repository
```
echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore
git clone https://github.com/Zaphoood/new-dotfiles $HOME/.cfg
```

Create an alias for managing the repository
```
alias dot-cfg='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/.git --work-tree=$HOME'
dot-cfg config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

Download the wallpaper (see below) or any other wallpaper you like and put it in `$HOME/Pictures/wallpaper/`. You may need to change the path to the wallpaper in i3's config file accordingly.

Useful tip: If you have want to commit all tracked files with changes to them, use `dot-cfg add -u` (instead of the usual `dot-cfg add -A`).

My rofi theme was inspired by [Eric Murphy's](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/archrice) dotfiles.
